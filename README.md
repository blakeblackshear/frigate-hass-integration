# Frigate HomeAssistant Integration

Provides the following:
- Rich media browser with thumbnails and navigation
- Sensor entities
- Camera entities
- Switch entities

## Installation
Copy `custom_components/frigate` to your `custom_components` folder in HomeAssistant. Also available via HACS as a [custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories). Note that HACS does not "configure" the integration for you. You must go to `Configuration > Integrations` and add Frigate after installing via HACS.

You will also need [media_source](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/media_source/) enabled in your Home Assistant configuration for the Media Browser to appear.
